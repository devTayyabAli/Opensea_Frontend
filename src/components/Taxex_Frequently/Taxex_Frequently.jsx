        We understand it can feel challenging to work through your purchases, sales, and transfers <br />
         to determine what taxes may apply. Thankfully, there are third-party services who can <br /> help. We recommend CoinTracker as one such service.

          CoinTracker is not an OpenSea product, and OpenSea does not share any information with CoinTracker. Items you purchased, sold, or transferred using OpenSea's services will be <br /> available  in your wallet address history. This history is public. CoinTracker will review your <br /> wallet address history to help you determine what taxes you may owe.
